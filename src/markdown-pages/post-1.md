## It's Probably a CRUD App

>The first hour of the Social Network is about making a CRUD app seem like sexy. -Patrick McKenzie

One of the biggest challenges for me in trying to understand the business side of tech is figuring out what exactly the company's product DOES. Not in high-minded business terms, but literally, what does it do? What does the UI look like? What data do you put in? What does the app do with that data? If I'm trying to figure out a free app, I can just try it out for myself. But if I'm trying to figure out what an app behind a paywall does, I'm kind of out of luck.

I understand that companies want to make their product sound as complex, technical, and generally amazing as possible. Which successfully makes their product sound better, but doesn't help me figure out what their product does.

I remember the great lengths The Social Network went through to make the building of Facebook's MVP look like "SUPER COMPLICATED SUPER SMART TECH STUFF". If I recall correctly, there was intense staring, insanely fast typing speed, and a custom colored IDE. And yet, the core of Facebook is basically a CRUD app. There's some other stuff going on now too (a lot in the interest of monitizing said CRUD app), but that was mostly added on later, after the core product (a CRUD app) had been built.

So now when I look at a company's product description and see things like "deliver patient multi-channel applications more quickly, with more reliability and functionality", I don't have to think "Um, that's really cool, but what does it DO?" I think "Oh, so it's a CRUD app".
